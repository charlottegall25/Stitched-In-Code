# Stitched-In-Code
Stitched in Code explores how digital code can replicate the imperfect, hand-made qualities of textile design and transform them back into a physical form. Inspired by Anna Spiroâ€™s bold and layered fabric patterns, this project uses Processing and the PEmbroider library to generate and export coded designs into embroidery files for a Brother SE425 machine. By merging creative coding with traditional craft, the project investigates the intersection of technology and tactility, showing how algorithmic precision can still evoke the beauty of human-made imperfection.
